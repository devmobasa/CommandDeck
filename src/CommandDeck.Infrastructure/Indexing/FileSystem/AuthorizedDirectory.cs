//   passes the leaf privacy and hidden checks is excluded by it.
// - Generated/Ignore: the directory was opened only because an include glob
//   could match below it; children that are not included inherit the
//   exclusion it would otherwise have had.
// - Repository: the ignore rules in force for the directory's children.
